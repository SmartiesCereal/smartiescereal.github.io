                <h3>About MoxCraft</h3>
                <p> Welcome to MoxCraft! Moxcraft is a 1.7.10 modded minecraft survival war server. Here, you'll be 
                    able to play with a variety of tech, weapon and adventure mods.
                    With your team, you'll gather resources together to make the most advanced weapons. 
                    Or perhaps you'll decide to take on mobzilla and craft the most overpowered set of tools and armour. 
                    <br><br>
                    Whatever you decide to do, just make sure your base is well secured and hidden or 
                    your enemies may decide to destroy it, be it with a nuclear missile or an apache helicopter.
                    <br><br>
                    To play on this server, you'll need to head to the Installations page and follow the instructions
                    so that all the necessary mods are loaded onto your computer. Then, simply connect to MoxCraft.serverminer.com
                    to join.
